# Canteen_Management_System

It's a Desktop Application, created using Java and Netbeans IDE.

Here people can order from the available food menu script. They can order any quantity of food. The App will calculate the bill and also decrease the item from the menu script.
The user can add, delete or update iteams in the menu in daily basis.

More developments are needed for this project.

Thank you.
